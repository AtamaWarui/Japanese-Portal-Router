Portal structure
1- Modifying the default Apache *DocumentRoot* directory in Debian OS to one of the main directories.
2- Creating a session id at the authentication that we store it in a cookie which expires after a certain time almost ~ 30 minutes, after a successful authentication we stored it again in a text file and we use it afterward for verification to aceess the other php pages.
3- ID and password stored in the hash format to secure more the credentials.
